# Undefined
undefined is both a value and data type

# Numbers

### "+" is used for bot concat and addition in JS
so 
```
a = 10 + 10
result  = 20 
```
But
```
a = 10 + "10"
result = 1010 
```
### it will prioritize string first so it will concat first .

but for "Arithmatic Operations" such as " / , * " 

js will convert the string to number type and then output the result
```
a = 10 * "20"
result = 200
```
